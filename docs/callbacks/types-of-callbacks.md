# Types of Callbacks

The framework provides different types of callbacks that trigger at various stages of an agent's execution. Understanding when each callback fires and what context it receives is key to using them effectively.

## Agent Lifecycle Callbacks

These callbacks are available on *any* agent that inherits from `BaseAgent` (including `LlmAgent`, `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`, etc).

### Before Agent Callback

**When:** Called *immediately before* the agent's `_run_async_impl` (or `_run_live_impl`) method is executed. It runs after the agent's `InvocationContext` is created but *before* its core logic begins.

**Purpose:** Ideal for setting up resources or state needed only for this specific agent's run, performing validation checks on the session state (callback\_context.state) before execution starts, logging the entry point of the agent's activity, or potentially modifying the invocation context before the core logic uses it.

```

### After Agent Callback

**When:** Called *immediately after* the agent's `_run_async_impl` (or `_run_live_impl`) method successfully completes. It does *not* run if the agent was skipped due to `before_agent_callback` returning content or if `end_invocation` was set during the agent's run.

**Purpose:** Useful for cleanup tasks, post-execution validation, logging the completion of an agent's activity, modifying final state, or augmenting/replacing the agent's final output.

## LLM Interaction Callbacks

These callbacks are specific to `LlmAgent` and provide hooks around the interaction with the Large Language Model.

### Before Model Callback

**When:** Called just before the `generate_content_async` (or equivalent) request is sent to the LLM within an `LlmAgent`'s flow.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of the request going to the LLM. Use cases include adding dynamic instructions, injecting few-shot examples based on state, modifying model config, implementing guardrails (like profanity filters), or implementing request-level caching.

**Return Value Effect:**  
If the callback returns `None`, the LLM continues its normal workflow. If the callback returns an `LlmResponse` object, then the call to the LLM is **skipped**. The returned `LlmResponse` is used directly as if it came from the model. This is powerful for implementing guardrails or caching.

```py
--8<-- "examples/python/snippets/callbacks/before_model_callback.py"
```

### After Model Callback

**When:** Called just after a response (`LlmResponse`) is received from the LLM, before it's processed further by the invoking agent.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection or modification of the raw LLM response. Use cases include

* logging model outputs,
* reformatting responses,
* censoring sensitive information generated by the model,
* parsing structured data from the LLM response and storing it in `callback_context.state`
* or handling specific error codes.

## Tool Execution Callbacks

These callbacks are also specific to `LlmAgent` and trigger around the execution of tools (including `FunctionTool`, `AgentTool`, etc.) that the LLM might request.

### Before Tool Callback

**When:** Called just before a specific tool's `run_async` method is invoked, after the LLM has generated a function call for it.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of tool arguments, performing authorization checks before execution, logging tool usage attempts, or implementing tool-level caching.

**Return Value Effect:**

1. If the callback returns `None`, the tool's `run_async` method is executed with the (potentially modified) `args`.  
2. If a dictionary is returned, the tool's `run_async` method is **skipped**. The returned dictionary is used directly as the result of the tool call. This is useful for caching or overriding tool behavior.  

```py
--8<-- "examples/python/snippets/callbacks/before_tool_callback.py"
```

### After Tool Callback

**When:** Called just after the tool's `run_async` method completes successfully.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of the tool's result before it's sent back to the LLM (potentially after summarization). Useful for logging tool results, post-processing or formatting results, or saving specific parts of the result to the session state.

**Return Value Effect:**

1. If the callback returns `None`, the original `tool_response` is used.  
2. If a new dictionary is returned, it **replaces** the original `tool_response`. This allows modifying or filtering the result seen by the LLM.
