# Local testing

Before you deploy your agent, you should test it locally to make sure it is
working as intended.

The easiest way is to test your a local agent is to use the ADK CLI with `adk api_server`, which launches a local Fast API server, where you can run cURL commands to test your agent.

## Working directory

First, ensure you are in the correct working directory:

```console
parent_folder    <-- you should be here
|- my_sample_agent
  |- __init__.py
  |- .env
  |- agent.py
```

### Launching your local Fast API server with `adk api_server`

Next, launch the local Fast API server:

```shell
adk api_server 
```

#### Expected Output

```shell
INFO:     Started server process [12345]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Your server is now running locally at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

### Creating a new session for your agent

Without closing this terminal, open a new terminal and create a new session with the agent using:

```shell
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"state": {"key1": "value1", "key2": 42}}'
```

Let's break down what's happening:  

* `http://0.0.0.0:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_123`: This creates a new session for your agent `my_sample_agent`, which is the name of the agent folder, for a user ID (`u_123`) and for a session ID (`s_123`). You can replace `my_sample_agent` with the name of your agent folder. You can replace `u_123` with a specific user ID, and `s_123` with a specific session ID.  
* `{"state": {"key1": "value1", "key2": 42}}`: This is optional. You can use this to customize the agent's pre-existing state (dict) when creating the session.  

This should return the session information, if created successfully.

#### Expected Output

```shell
{"id":"s_123","app_name":"my_sample_agent","user_id":"u_123","state":{"state":{"key1":"value1","key2":42}},"events":[],"last_update_time":1743711430.022186}
```

ðŸ’¡ Tip:  

* you cannot create multiple sessions with exactly the same user ID and session ID. If you try to, you may see a response, like: `{"detail":"Session already exists: s_123"}`. To fix this, you can either delete that session (e.g. `s_123`), or choose a different session ID.

### Sending a query to your agent

There are two ways to send queries via POST to your agent, via `/run` or `/run_sse`.  

* `POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run`: collects all events as a list and returns the list all at once. Suitable for most users (if you are unsure, we recommend using this one).  
* `POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run_sse`: returns as Server-Sent-Events, which is a stream of event objects. Suitable for those who want to be notified as soon as the event is available. With `/run_sse`, you can also set `streaming` to `true` to enable token-level streaming.

#### With `/run`

```shell
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"app_name": "my_sample_agent",
"user_id": "u_123",
"session_id": "s_123",
"new_message": {
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [{
    "text": "Hey whats the weather in new york today"
    }]
}
}'
```

##### Expected Output

If using `/run`, you will see the full output of events at the same time, as a list:

```shell
[{"content":{"parts":[{"functionCall":{"id":"af-e75e946d-c02a-4aad-931e-49e4ab859838","args":{"city":"new york"},"name":"get_weather"}}],"role":"model"},"invocation_id":"e-71353f1e-aea1-4821-aa4b-46874a766853","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"state_delta":{},"artifact_delta":{},"requested_auth_configs":{}},"long_running_tool_ids":[],"id":"2Btee6zW","timestamp":1743712220.385936},{"content":{"parts":[{"functionResponse":{"id":"af-e75e946d-c02a-4aad-931e-49e4ab859838","name":"get_weather","response":{"status":"success","report":"The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit)."}}}],"role":"user"},"invocation_id":"e-71353f1e-aea1-4821-aa4b-46874a766853","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"state_delta":{},"artifact_delta":{},"requested_auth_configs":{}},"id":"PmWibL2m","timestamp":1743712221.895042},{"content":{"parts":[{"text":"OK. The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).\n"}],"role":"model"},"invocation_id":"e-71353f1e-aea1-4821-aa4b-46874a766853","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"state_delta":{},"artifact_delta":{},"requested_auth_configs":{}},"id":"sYT42eVC","timestamp":1743712221.899018}]
```

#### With `/run_sse`

```shell
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run_sse \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"app_name": "my_sample_agent",
"user_id": "u_123",
"session_id": "s_123",
"new_message": {
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [{
    "text": "Hey whats the weather in new york today"
    }]
},
"streaming": false 
}'
```

You can set `streaming` to `true` to enable token-level streaming, which means the response will be returned to you in multiple chunks.

##### Expected Output

```shell
data: {"content":{"parts":[{"functionCall":{"id":"af-f83f8af9-f732-46b6-8cb5-7b5b73bbf13d","args":{"city":"new york"},"name":"get_weather"}}],"role":"model"},"invocation_id":"e-3f6d7765-5287-419e-9991-5fffa1a75565","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"state_delta":{},"artifact_delta":{},"requested_auth_configs":{}},"long_running_tool_ids":[],"id":"ptcjaZBa","timestamp":1743712255.313043}

data: {"content":{"parts":[{"functionResponse":{"id":"af-f83f8af9-f732-46b6-8cb5-7b5b73bbf13d","name":"get_weather","response":{"status":"success","report":"The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit)."}}}],"role":"user"},"invocation_id":"e-3f6d7765-5287-419e-9991-5fffa1a75565","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"state_delta":{},"artifact_delta":{},"requested_auth_configs":{}},"id":"5aocxjaq","timestamp":1743712257.387306}

data: {"content":{"parts":[{"text":"OK. The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).\n"}],"role":"model"},"invocation_id":"e-3f6d7765-5287-419e-9991-5fffa1a75565","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"state_delta":{},"artifact_delta":{},"requested_auth_configs":{}},"id":"rAnWGSiV","timestamp":1743712257.391317}
```

Note: if using `/run_sse`, you should see each event as soon as it is available.

### Deploying your agent?

Now that you've verified the local operation of your agent, you're ready to move on to deploying your agent!

Here are some ways you can deploy your agent:

* Deploying to [Agent Engine](../deploy/agent-engine.md), the easiest way to deploy your ADK agents to Vertex AI on Google Cloud.  
* Deploying to [Cloud Run](../deploy/cloud-run.md), and have full control over how you want to manage your auto-scaling container on Google Cloud.  

## Test Intergrations

ADK can be integrated with third-party observability solutions using [Callbacks](../callbacks/index.md) to capture traces of agent calls, interactions and usage. Supported third-party solutions:

* [Comet Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik) is an open-source LLM observability and evaluation platform that natively supports ADK [docs](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/integrations/adk).
